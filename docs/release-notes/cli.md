## Unreleased

## v11.3.0

### Host projects support
Developers can launch Neutralinojs from any programming language using child process APIs (i.e., `subprocess` in Python) and communicate with the framework process using the extension API. The new `hostProject` configuration object extends the official CLI to help developers easily create, run, and build these host projects. For example, the following host project configuration instructs the CLI to run a Node.js host project:

```json
"hostProject": {
  "projectPath": "/node-src",
  "buildPath": "/node-src/dist/",
  "initCommand": "npm install",  
  "devCommand": "npm start",     
  "buildCommand": "npm run build"
}
```

Community projects implement bindings and templates to create host projects using Node.js, Python, Go, etc. For example, the [`node-neutralino`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-neutralino) NPM package lets you launch Neutralinojs via Node.js environments and execute native APIs via the `NeutralinoApp` class:

```js
import NeutralinoApp from 'node-neutralino';

const app = new NeutralinoApp({
  url: '/',
  windowOptions: {
    enableInspector: false,
  }
});

app.init();
app.window.setTitle('Node.js');
```

### Executable icon and metadata on Windows
Now, the `neu build` command automatically updates the executable file icon and metadata based on the following configuration options:

- `author`: gets written into executable's metadata.
- `description`: gets written into executable's metadata.
- `copyright`: gets written into executable's metadata. Defaults to current date + generic "all rights reserved".
- `applicationName`: gets written into executable's metadata. Defaults to `cli.binaryName`.
- `applicationIcon`: a relative path to an icon in `.png` format. Defaults to `modes.window.icon`. If it is not set, uses Neutralinojs logo.

### Bugfixes/improvements
Use the `zip-lib` package to handle ZIP files for better performance and simplicity in the source code.

## v11.2.2

### Bugfixes/improvements
- Fix initial loading issues with frontend library development file patching.

## v11.2.0

## Core: Bundler
- Introduce the `--clean` flag to the `neu build` command to clean previous build files.
- Add file excluding feature for the app bundle and extensions directory via `cli.resourcesExclude` and `cli.extensionsExclude` configuration properties. For example, now developers can use the `"resourcesExclude": ".*\\.scss$|.*\\.d.ts$"` configuration to exclude `*.scss` and `*.d.ts` files from the final app bundle.
- Let app developers customize the frontend library development server wait time using the `cli.frontendLibrary.waitTimeout` configuration property.

## Core: Version
- The `neu version` command now compares the installed CLI version and the framework version with the latest released versions and displays a warning messages if the users use an older versions.
- The `neu version` command now displays the `(latest)` tag with CLI, binary, client library version details.

### Bugfixes/improvements
- Check and validate `neutralino.config.json` file before executing app-specific commands.
- Check app template validity before downloading content from a specific GitHub repository using the official GitHub API.
- Add the app icon to the final app bundle only the specific project uses an app icon.
- Fix the port waiting timeout issue with frontend library-based development workflow. 

## v11.1.0

### Core: Bundler
- Add `cli.distributionPath` into the `neutralino.config.json` file to customize the default `dist` distribution directory.

## v11.0.1

### Bugfixes/improvements
- Clean existing app build files before creating another build using the `neu build` command.
- Support older Node versions by removing the optional chaining feature usage.
- Fix the endless port waiting issue with the `--frontend-lib-dev` option.

## v11.0.0

### Core: Runner
- Change the WebSocket connection based on the v5 framework APIs.

### Bugfixes/improvements
- Fixed issues with the frontend library command execution.

## v10.1.1

### Bugfixes/improvements
- Fixed app development issues with the Vite server.

## v10.1.0

### Bugfixes/improvements
- Fixed several issues in the frontend-library-based development flow (i.e., removed the hardcoded port number, fixed double `devCommand` execution, etc.,).

## v10.0.0

### Core: frontend-library-based development
Added new configuration options to the `cli.frontendLibrary` key of the `neutralino.config.json`:
- `projectPath`: Sets the project path of the frontend-library project. This path will be used as the current directory while executing the frontend-app-related commands.
- `initCommand`: A command that gets executed after downloading an app template with the `neu create` command.
- `devCommand`: This command will run with the `neu run` command to start the frontend development server. The CLI doesn't wait for `devCommand` completion, instead, it will wait for the frontend development server via the [`tcp-port-used`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tcp-port-used) package. 
- `buildCommand`: The `neu build` command will execute this command before generating the app bundle, so you can generate static resources of your frontend app using this command.

## v9.8.0

### Core: Downloader
- Download the latest Neutralinojs framework resources with the `--latest` option in the `neu update` command.
- If framework versions are not present in the app/template configuration, download the latest framework resources automatically. The CLI will download nightly releases if it can't fetch the latest release tag because of an GitHub API-related issue (i.e., Exceeded rate limits).

## v9.7.0

### Core: Downloader/bundler
- Download the TypeScript definition file for standalone client library mode. This won't include the TypeScript definition file to the final application bundle.
