title: Extensions Overview
---

Neutralinos framework offers a native API to perform various operating-system-level operations such as accessing
filesystem, executing commands, and showing dialog boxes, etc. You may need other native APIs like database connectors
to build your applications. But, we can't add all specific APIs to the core and make the framework bloaty. Instead,
we offer a WebSocket-based extension system to extend Neutralinojs API without even asking you to build Neutralinojs from source.

You can write custom backend code for your application with any programming language thanks to the flexible
extensions API. Also, the extensions API helps you to include Neutralinojs process as a part of any source file.

## Defining the extensions

First, you need to define extensions you use in `neutralinojs.config.json` with the following structure.

```json
"extensions": [
    {
        "id": "js.neutralino.sampleextension",
        "commandLinux": "${NL_PATH}/extensions/binary/linux/ext_bin",
        "commandDarwin": "${NL_PATH}/extensions/binary/mac/ext_bin",
        "commandWindows": "${NL_PATH}/extensions/binary/win/ext_bin.exe"
    },
    {
        "id": "js.neutralino.binaryextension",
        "command": "node ${NL_PATH}/extensions/binary/main.js",
    }
]
```

- `id` String: A unique key to identify each extension.
- `command` String (optional): A cross-platform command to start the extension. Eg: `node ${NL_PATH}/extensions/binary/main.js`
will work on every platform.
- `commandLinux` String (optional): Extension startup command for Linux.
- `commandDarwin` String (optional): Extension startup command for macOS.
- `commandWindows` String (optional): Extension startup command for Windows.

## Enable the extensions feature

The extensions API is disabled by default. Enable extensions by adding the following setting to your app config.

```json
"enableExtensions": true
```

## Connecting an extension with Neutralinojs

As you already noticed, an extension is just a separate process. Neutralinojs starts spawning extension instances
 during the framework bootstrap process and initiates each extension process with the following process arguments.

- `--nl-port=<port>`: port of the Neutralinojs server.
- `--nl-token=<token>`: Access token to use the native API.
- `--nl-extension-id=<id>`: Extension identifier.

Now, you can connect with the Neutralinojs server with the above process arguments. Use the following WebSocket
URL to initiate a new WebSocket connection.

```
ws://localhost:{port}?extensionId={extensionId}
```

## Sending a message from app to an extension

The extensions API uses an event-based messaging protocol. Every message uses the following JSON structure.

```json
{
    "event": "<event_name>",
    "data" : {

    }
}
```

Use the built-in extensions API to send a message to any extension, as shown below.

```js
let extension = 'js.neutralino.sampleextension';
let event = 'helloExtension';
let data = {
    testValue: 10
};

await Neutralino.extensions.dispatch(extension, event, data);
```

The above code snippet sends a message to the `js.neutralino.sampleextension` extension instance. You can send
messages to extensions with the `dispatch` function anytime. If you send a message before the extension connects
with the main process, the Neutralinojs client library queues and sends it when the target extension's connection is
established. In other words, you don't need to worry about extensions' status when you send messages to
extensions.

## Sending a message from the extension to app

When you connect your extensions with the Neutralinojs main process, you can call the native API by sending
WebSocket messages to the Neutralinojs process directly. Neutralinojs server processes messages based on the
following format.

```json
{
    "id": "<id>",
    "method": "<method>",
    "accessToken": "<token>",
    "data": {

    }
}
```

- `id` String: A [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) v4 string.
- `method` String: Native method name. Eg: `window.setTitle`.
- `accessToken` String: Access token generated by the Neutralinojs server.
- `data` Object (optional): Parameters for the native method.

You can invoke the `app.broadcast` native method to send messages to all app instances. Register a callback
with the `events.on` in the application code to receive the message send by the extension process.

## Terminating an extension instance

Neutralinojs doesn't send kill signals to all extension instances during exit. Therefore, you have to stop
the extension process when the WebSocket-based IPC closes. See the following sample Node.js extension:

## Using Neutralinojs from your source files

The above approach helps you to extend Neutralinojs API with a custom backend code. Neutralinojs process can
spawn multiple extensions as child processes and communicate with the internal messaging protocol. On the other
hand, you can spawn Neutralinojs processes from your own processes and communicate with the same messaging
protocol. Using this approach, it's possible to write Neutralinojs apps with any backend language.

You can obtain authentication details for the Neutralinojs process by setting your config as below.

```json
"exportAuthInfo": true
```

The above setting exports authentication details to `${NL_PATH}/.tmp/auth_info.json` with the following format.

```json
{
    "port": "<port>",
    "accessToken": "<token>"
}
```

Connect with the Neutralinojs process by using the extension API as usual.
