## Framework

### Error Code 127: `libayatana-appindicator3.so.1 cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`

We fixed this issue in [v4.5.0](https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/releases/tag/v4.5.0), so please upgrade your framework version.
If you need to use a lower framework version, you need to install the missing package with the following commands to start the app properly:

```
apt update
apt install -y libayatana-appindicator3-1
```

Make sure to run the above commands with `sudo`. Check [the package information](https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/18.04/ubuntu-universe-amd64/libayatana-appindicator3-1_0.5.3-3_amd64.deb.html) for further reference.

## CLI

### What should I do when I get `Missing permission to execute the native method: <namespace.func>` error ?

This error occurs when permissions are not given to execute a specific native method. To be able to run this function, add the `namespace.func` to the `nativeAllowList`. To allow all functions of the particular namespace, use `namespace.*`. Check [here](https://neutralino.js.org/docs/configuration/neutralino.config.json/#nativeallowlist-string) to learn more about allowlists.
