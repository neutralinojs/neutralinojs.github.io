Great open-source software is a result of the collaboration of enthusiastic developers.
Anyone can help Neutralino by contributing code and reporting bugs. This document explains how to
start contributing Neutralinojs.

Note that this guide is for contributors. If you are getting started with Neutralinojs app development,
you can start from [here](../getting-started/your-first-neutralinojs-app.mdx).

## Setup and build the framework

### Cloning the repository

First, clone the main repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs.git
cd neutralinojs
```

### Installing compilation tools and dependencies

### Linux

No need for separate compilers because Linux distributions usually have GNU C/C++ compilers installed already.

Install GTK, WebKit, other libraries with the following command.

**Ubuntu**

```bash
sudo apt install \
    libgtk-3-dev \
    libwebkit2gtk-4.0-37 \
    libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev
```

**Fedora**

```bash
sudo dnf install \
    @development-tools \
    gtk3 \
    webkit2gtk3.x86_64 \
    webkit2gtk3-devel.x86_64
```

**Arch**

```bash
sudo pacman -S \
    gtk3 \
    webkit2gtk
```

### Windows

Install the latest Visual Studio IDE. Neutralinojs compilation on Windows will use
MSVC (aka `cl.exe`) C++ compiler.

### macOS

Install Xcode Command Line Tools.

### Compile the Neutralinojs framework.

Run the following script in order build the framework.

```bash
python scripts/bz.py
```

:::info
You need to have the [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) interpreter (version 3.x) installed to run this script.
:::

## Setup and build the client

Neutralinojs apps communicate with the Neutralinojs process via a WebSocket connection. This WebSocket connection
gets initiated by the Neutralinojs client.

Clone the client repository to the same directory where you downloaded the main repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralino.js.git
cd neutralino.js
```

Install developer dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Executing the test app

The main repository has a simple test application that you can use during development related activities.
You can enter the following command from the main repository to build and update the test app's client.

```bash
bash ./scripts/update_client.sh
```

Now run the newly compiled test app with the following command.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="Linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'Linux'},
    {label: 'macOS', value: 'macOS'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'Windows'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="Linux">

```bash
./bin/neutralino-linux_x64 --load-dir-res
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macOS">

```bash
./bin/neutralino-mac_x64 --load-dir-res
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Windows">

```bash
./bin/neutralino-win_x64.exe --load-dir-res
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Testing

Testing is a crucial part in every development activity. Every pull request in the main codebase will trigger
the following automated tests.

- Builds on Linux, macOS, and Windows with x64 machines.
- Integration test suite.

However, you can run our integration test suite from your local computer too with the following command
from the main codebase's directory.

```bash
cd spec
npm install
npm run test
```

It's always good to run the test suite for the module you've updated with the following command.

```bash
npm run test <module> # Eg: npm run test filesystem
```

:::info
If you need to run tests for the `extensions` module, make sure to enter `npm install` from
`./bin/extensions/sampleextension` first.
:::

The above command will run test only for the given module.

## Project directory structure

### Framework

- `api`: The native API implementation and controllers. Written in REST API style.
- `auth`: Authentication and permissions-related logic.
- `bin`: Test app source code.
- `lib`: Third-party libraries source files.
- `server`: WebSocket/HTTP communication endpoints.
- `spec`: Integration/API test suite.
- `scripts`: Contains automation scripts to build the framework, generate release notes, update the client library, and build `resources.neu` for the test app.

### Client library

Source: [github.com/neutralinojs/neutralino.js](https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralino.js)

- `src/api`: JavaScript API frontend and implementaion.
- `src/browser`: Browser-related API implementation.
- `src/debug`: Developer mode features.
- `src/ws`: WebSocket client implementaion.
- `scripts`: Contains automation scripts to generate release notes.

## Contribution guidelines

Before, contributing to the codebase, please check the following things.

- Discuss the feature/improvement/bug-fix with the Neutralinojs team via GitHub discussions.
- Get familiar with the code style. Write your code according to the
  [Neutralinojs code style guide](code-style-guide.md).
- Become familiar with all modules in the codebase.
- Avoid adding new features to only one platform.

Thanks for helping us to make Neutralinojs better!
