Great open-source software is a result of the collaboration of enthusiastic developers.
Anyone can help Neutralino by contributing code and reporting bugs. This document explains how to
start contributing Neutralinojs.

Note that this guide is for framework developers. If you are getting started with Neutralinojs app development,
you can start from [here](../getting-started/your-first-neutralinojs-app.mdx).

## Setup and build the framework

### Cloning the repository

First, clone the main repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs.git
cd neutralinojs
```

### Installing compilation tools and dependencies

#### Linux

No need for separate compilers because Linux distributions usually have GNU C/C++ compilers installed already.

Install GTK, WebKit, CMake, Ninja, other libraries with the following command.

##### Debian

```bash
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev cmake ninja-build
```

```bash
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0
# --- or ---
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-37
```

##### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install \
    @development-tools \
    gtk3 \
    webkit2gtk3.x86_64 \
    webkit2gtk3-devel.x86_64 \
    libgtk-3-dev \
    libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0 \ # or libwebkit2gtk-4.0-37
    libglib2.0-dev \
    libxrandr-dev \
    cmake \
    ninja-build
```

##### Arch

```bash
sudo pacman -S \
    gtk3 \
    webkit2gtk \
    cmake \
    ninja
```

#### Windows

Install Visual Studio Build Tools or the Visual Studio IDE with the Windows SDK. The compilation process uses the MSVC C++ compiler (aka `cl.exe`) and requires [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (as the build system generator) and [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) (as the build executor).

:::info
How to activate Windows 10 SDK: While installing it in the Visual Studio Installer, go to tab Workloads, section "Desktop & Mobile" and select "Desktop development with C++". On the right in "Installation details" > "Desktop development with C++" > "Optional", make sure "Windows 10 SDK" is checked.
:::

#### macOS

Install Xcode Command Line Tools.

CMake and Ninja are also required and can be installed via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install cmake ninja
```

### Compile the Neutralinojs framework.

Run the following script in order to build the framework binaries.

1. Create a `build/` directory in the main repository.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="Linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'Linux'},
    {label: 'macOS', value: 'macOS'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'Windows'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="Linux">

```bash
mkdir build
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macOS">

```bash
mkdir -p build
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Windows">

```bash
mkdir build
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. Generate Ninja build files.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="Linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'Linux'},
    {label: 'macOS', value: 'macOS'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'Windows'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="Linux">

```bash
cmake . -G Ninja -B build

# --- Cross compile for ARM64 (optional) ---
cmake . -G Ninja -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/linux-aarch64.cmake

# --- Cross compile for ARM32 (optional) ---
cmake . -G Ninja -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/linux-armhf.cmake
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macOS">

```bash
cmake . -G Ninja -B build
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Windows">

```bash
cmake . -G Ninja -B build
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

3. Compile the project.

```bash
ninja -C build
```

This project uses CMake and Ninja to configure and build native binaries for local development and CI/CD environments. Developers can provide custom toolchains or platform-specific configurations to target additional platforms.

## Setup and build the client

Neutralinojs apps communicate with the Neutralinojs process via a WebSocket connection. This WebSocket connection
gets initiated by the Neutralinojs client.

Clone the client repository to the same directory where you downloaded the main repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralino.js.git
cd neutralino.js
```

Install developer dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Executing the test app

The main repository has a simple test application that you can use during development related activities.
You can enter the following command from the main repository to build and update the test app's client.

```bash
bash ./scripts/update_client.sh
```

Now run the newly compiled test app with the following command.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="Linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'Linux'},
    {label: 'macOS', value: 'macOS'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'Windows'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="Linux">

```bash
./bin/neutralino-linux_x64 --load-dir-res
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macOS">

```bash
# For Intel processors (x64)
./bin/neutralino-mac_x64 --load-dir-res

# For new Apple processors (arm64)
./bin/neutralino-mac_arm64 --load-dir-res
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Windows">

```bash
./bin/neutralino-win_x64.exe --load-dir-res
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Testing

Testing is a crucial part in every development activity. Every pull request in the main codebase will trigger
the following automated tests.

- Builds on Linux, macOS, and Windows with x64 machines.
- Integration test suite.

However, you can run our integration test suite from your local computer too with the following command
from the main codebase's directory.

```bash
cd spec
npm install
npm run test
```

It's always good to run the test suite for the module you've updated with the following command.

```bash
npm run test <module> # Eg: npm run test filesystem
```

:::info
If you need to run tests for the `extensions` module, make sure to enter `npm install` from
`./bin/extensions/sampleextension` first.
:::

The above command will run test only for the given module.

### Adding a new test case

To add a test case simply add it to the `spec/<module>.spec.js` file.
For example, if you need to add a new test case to the `debug` module, add the test case to the `spec/debug.spec.js` file. 

Next, run the test suite for that specific module, as shown in the following command snippet:

```bash
cd spec
npm i 
npm run test debug
```

## Contribution guidelines

Before, contributing to the codebase, please check the following things.

- Discuss the feature/improvement/bug-fix with the Neutralinojs team via GitHub discussions.
- Get familiar with the code style. Write your code according to the
  [Neutralinojs code style guide](code-style-guide.md).
- Become familiar with all modules in the codebase.
- Avoid adding new features to only one platform.

Thanks for helping us to make Neutralinojs better!
