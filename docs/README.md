### Develop web apps with native os functions.

NeutralinoJs is a portable and lightweight framework. It lets you develop apps with native functions that can run inside web browsers. 

In electron and NWjs you have to install NodeJs and hundreds of dependency libraries. Embedded Chromium and Node creates large overhead and makes even simple apps like “hello world” considerable in size. Neutralino offers a solution for this issue.

### Features of Neutralino apps

- Portable development and deployment
- Zero additional dependencies
- Do native functionalities in your app - Read files, run system commands just using js.
- Super performance and lightweight
