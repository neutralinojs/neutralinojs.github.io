## Understanding NeutralinoJs

- NeutralinoJs is a desktop/cloud application development framework.
- NeutralinoJs apps run in browser, rather than standalone desktop apps. 
- You will need knowledge of Web technologies to build NeutralinoJs apps. 
- The project is fairly new for now, lacking contributors for a fast paced development.

## Contribute with Care
We appreciate your interest, and your enthusiasm is what may help this project to build further, 
but here are certain things we would like you to take care of while contributing.

1. Contribute in chunks, a lot of changes may break the master branch, and there might be certain changes we would not want to make. 
In this case, it is advisable to contribute by making changes to a few related files at once.

2. Please have a look at the `README` of the repository you want to contribute to. 
Sometimes, the information that is only meant for particular repository is provided in its README, so have a look at it before you start making your contribution(s).

3. Please be consistent wih the style being followed already while making any changes, 
we will add the style guide later, but for now please consider having a look at the previously added files.

4. Consider talking to a contributor or in any NeutralinoJs community, if you want to propose any changes on the current state of the project.

5. Last but not the least, Good Luck with your contribution(s).
